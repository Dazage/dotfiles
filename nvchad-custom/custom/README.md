# Example_config

This can be used as an example custom config for NvChad, this branch is a minimal one. Do check the feature_full branch if you need all the ease in your config.

# dmt's config

I've opted for more or less the defaults of NvChad. This config only has minor differences from the example config provided by NvChad. Hats off to them!
